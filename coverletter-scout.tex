\begin{cvletter}

\lettersection{About }{Me}
With 5 years of experience developing changes to a tier 1 WMS for a nearly billion dollar wholesale and 3pl distribution company, which had the ability to handle tens of thousands of shipments per day, has given me an extensive insight into the requirements and expectations of warehouse associates.  During the 5 years as a warehouse system developer, I spent time as a lead developer and worked closely with all portions of the business, from warehouse associates, operations managers and director of operations to buyers, sales and multiple VPs.  I would manage all aspects of the system from requirement gathering to design, development, launch and support, while also being responsible for system uptime and any performance issues.  I then transitioned into web development with the hope of expanding my knowledge of software development.  Since then, I've been put on projects ranging from performance enhancements, to systemwide issues with UTC date calculations, to an overhaul of single sign-on throughout an array of web applications.

\lettersection{Why }{Me?}
My experience working as a warehouse associate and warehouse lead along with my expertise of developing changes to a WMS puts me in a unique position where I have an understanding of the issues users have with the processes of a WMS and also the ability to help resolve those issues and make the end user experience smoother and more satisfying.

I look forward to learning more about the software engineer position.  Feel free to contact me to schedule a meeting.  Thank you.
